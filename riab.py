    '''The QGIS interface implementation for the Risk in a box plugin.

    This class acts as the 'glue' between QGIS and our custom logic.

        On instantiation, the plugin instance will be assigned a copy
        of the QGIS iface object which will allow this plugin to access and
        manipulate the running QGIS instance that spawned it.

        Args:
           iface - a Quantum GIS QGisAppInterface instance. This instance
           is automatically passed to the plugin by QGIS when it loads the
           plugin.
