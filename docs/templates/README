The index-[locale].html files will be copied to index.html on a per locale basis 
by the scripts/post_translate.sh script. So you should never place an index.html
here as it will be deleted automatically. If you want to create a new locale index
page just name it index-[locale].html and the scripts will do the rest for you.
