"InaSAFE is a plugin for QGIS software. It aims to produce realistic natural "
"hazard impact scenarios for better planning, preparedness and response "
"activities, using hazard and exposure geographic data. A user’s manual "
"developed by Ole Moeller Nielsen and Tim Sutton complements this short "
"training material. During this training, you will explore the different "
"components of InaSAFE plugin and their usage for an easy-to-use risk and "
"impact scenarios assessments. A data sample will be provided with the "
"present material to give you the ability to learn how to manipulate data in "
"InaSAFE, what the requirements of the data are and what kind of results you "
"can expect out of the data."
