Internationalisation Support
============================

Rules of the road:

* Classes and anonymous functions that do not inherit QObject should use 
  the format :samp:`QCoreApplication.translate('Riab', 'Translations loaded')`
* Classes that inherit QObject should use the form :samp:`self.tr('foo')`
