**Rating**: 3

**Title**: Die or be displaced

**Synopsis**: To asses the impact of earthquake on population based on earthquake model developed by ITB

**Actions**: Provide details about the population will be die or displaced

**Limitation**: 

* The model is based on limited number of observed fatality rates during 4 past fatal events.
* The model clearly over-predicts the fatality rates atintensities higher than VIII.
* The model only estimates the expected fatality rate for a given intensity level; however the associated uncertainty for the proposed model is not addressed.
* There are few known mistakes in developing the current model:
- rounding MMI values to the nearest 0.5,
- Implementing Finite-Fault models of candidate events, and
- consistency between selected GMPEs with those in use by BMKG.

This model was developed by Institut Tecknologi Bandung (ITB) and implemented by Dr Hadi Ghasemi, Geoscience Australia
Algorithm:
In this study, the same functional form as Allen (2009) is adopted o express fatality rate as a function of intensity (see Eq. 10 in the report). The Matlab built-in function (fminsearch) for  Nelder-Mead algorithm was used to estimate the model parameters. The objective function (L2G norm) that is minimized during the optimisation is the same as the one used by Jaiswal et al. (2010).
The coefficients used in the indonesian model are x=0.62275231, y=8.03314466, zeta=2.15
