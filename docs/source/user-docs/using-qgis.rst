==========
Using QGIS
==========

Risk in a box uses `Quantum GIS (QGIS)<http://qgis.org>`- as the platform on 
which to provide its functionality. QGIS itself has good documentation and 
a very helpful user community. In this section we focus on those aspects of
QGIS functionality that will be helpful to someone wanting to carry out
impact scenario assessments using Risk in a Box.

Things to cover (suggested by Trias Aditya)

- access to statistics data
- access to WFS (for exposure data)
- access to WMS (for background data)
- you have got an idea to access WCS (e.g. hazard, elevation data etc)
- map the projected impact into graphical charts (this will be my
  favourites then...)
