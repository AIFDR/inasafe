Using the Risk in a Box Plugin
==============================

This document describes the useage of the Risk in a Box 'dock panel' - which
is the main interface for running risk scenarios within the Quantum GIS
environment.

In order to use the Risk in a Box tool effectively, you should probably also 
read the  :doc:`keywords` and :doc:`impact_functions` documentation before 
you get started.
