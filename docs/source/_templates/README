Put template (e.g. layout.html) overrides etc in here

I have added some static content to make the landing page (index.html) and
extended layout to add a menu link back to the landing page.

The layout.html overrides the *header* block from 
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sphinx/themes/agogo/layout.html
in order to add the Home | Contents links to the menu bar. If you switch 
theme you will probably need to make a similar update.
