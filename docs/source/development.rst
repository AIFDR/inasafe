Requirements to develop Risk-in-a-Box
-------------------------------------

Risk-in-a-box is built in python and runs as a plugin in `QGIS
<http://qgis.org>`_.  The Graphical User Interface components are built using
`PyQt4 <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro>`_ and the QGIS
plugin API (useful resources: `the QGIS Python Cookbook
<http://qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/>`_ and `the QGIS C++ API documentation
<http://qgis.org/api/>`_).  As such it is helpful if you are familiar with these
technologies (python, Qt4, PyQt4, QGIS). In addition, the following are needed
on your machine in order to work effectively with the code base:

* git
* subversion
* pep8
* nosetests (with coverage plugin)
* python-numpy (for numerical computations)
* python-gdal (python bindings to underlying gis functionality)
* python-sphinx (compilation of documents)
* pyqt4-dev-tools (compiling ui and resources)
* qt4-doc (qt4 API documentation)


On an ubuntu system you can install these requirements using apt::

  sudo apt-get install git subversion pep8 python-nose python-coverage \
  python-gdal python-numpy python-sphinx pyqt4-dev-tools


In some cases these dependencies may already be on your system via installation
process you followed for QGIS.

Quick Installation Guide - Developers
-------------------------------------

To develop on the plugin, you first need to copy it to your local system. If
you are a developer, the simplest way to do that is go to
`~/.qgis/python/plugins` and clone risk_in_a_box from our GitHub repository
page like this::

  git clone git://github.com/AIFDR/risk_in_a_box.git  (for read only)
  git clone git@github.com:AIFDR/risk_in_a_box.git    (to commit changes)

To verify that the installation works you can run the test suite from the command line::

  make test

This will run all the regression tests and also highlight any code issues.
Note that first time the tests are run they will pull 250MB of test data from
our subversion repository (If asked for a password just hit Enter). See further
notes on running tests below.


To run the plugin start QGIS and enable it from the :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage Plugins`
menu.

Development using Eclipse IDE with PyDev
----------------------------------------

If you wish to use an IDE for development, please refer to
`this article <http://linfiniti.com/2011/12/remote-debugging-qgis-python-plugins-with-pydev/>`_
for detailed information on how to get the basic Eclipse with PyDev setup.

Configuring your Eclipse project
................................

The procedure for doing this is to do: :menuselection:`File --> New --> Project...` and
then from the resulting dialog do :menuselection:`PyDev --> PyDev Project`.

In the resulting project dialog, set the following details:

* :guilabel:`Project name:` : :kbd:`risk_in_a_box`
* :guilabel:`Use default` : :kbd:`uncheck`
* :guilabel:`Directory` : :kbd:`/home/<your user name/.qgis/python/plugins/risk_in_a_box/`
* :guilabel:`Choose project type` : :kbd:`Python`
* :guilabel:`Grammar Version` : :kbd:`2.7`
* :guilabel:`Add project directory to PYTHONPATH?` : :kbd:`check`

At this point you should should click the link entitled 'Please configure an interpreter
in related preferences before continuing.' And on the resulting dialog do:


* :guilabel:`Python Interpreters: New...` : :kbd:`click this button`

In the dialog that appears do:

* :guilabel:`Interpreter Name` : :kbd:`System Python 2.7`
* :guilabel:`Interpreter Executable` : :kbd:`/usr/bin/python`
* :guilabel:`OK Button` : :kbd:`click this button`

Another dialog will appear. Tick the first entry in the list that points to your::

~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_3.7.0_155965261/plugins/org.python.pydev_2.3.0.2011121518/

(or simply click the 'Select All' button)

* :guilabel:`OK Button` : :kbd:`click this button`

You will be returned to the Python Interpreters list and should see an entry for
System Python 2.7 listed there. Now do in the *Libraries* tab:

* :guilabel:`Finish` : :kbd:`click this button`

Running Unit tests from the IDE
...............................

Python has very good integrated support for unit testing. The first thing
you should do after setting up the IDE project is to run the tests. You can run tests
in the following ways:

* For the entire risk_in_a_box package
* For individual sub packages (e.g. engine, gui, storage, impact_functions)
* for an individual test module within a package
* for an class within a test module
* for an individual method within a test class

You can view these individual entities by browsing and expanding nodes in the project
panel in the left of the IDE.

.. note:: If you run the test suite for the entire risk_in_a_box package, it will
    mistakenly treat the sphinx documentation conf.py (docs.source.conf) as a test
    and fail for that test. This is 'normal' and can be ignored.

Remote Debugging with Eclipse
.............................

For remote debugging, you should add pydevd to your PYTHONPATH before starting *QGIS*
for example (you will need to adjust these paths to match your system)::

	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/timlinux/.eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_3.7.0_155965261/plugins/org.python.pydev.debug_2.3.0.2011121518/pysrc/

.. note::

   If you are running with remote debugging enabled, be sure to start the
   PyDev debug server first before launching the Risk-in-a-box QGIS plugin
   otherwise QGIS will likely crash when it can't find the debug server.

You will need to ensure that the PYTHONPATH containing your pydev package folder
is set before you launch QGIS - for example by adding the above line to your ~/.bashrc
or by making a small batch file containing the above export and then sourcing the file
before launching QGIS e.g.::

    source riab_paths.sh
    /usr/local/bin/qgis


Additional development environment notes
----------------------------------------

QGIS installed in a non-standard location
.........................................

For running unit tests that need QGIS, you may need to adjust PYTHONPATH and QGISPATH
if QGIS is running in a non standard location. For example with QGIS built from source
into /usr/local (and python bindings global install option disabled), you could run
these commands (or add them to your ~/.bashrc)::

	export QGISPATH=/usr/local
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/share/qgis/python/

.. note:: The above can be set within Eclipse's project properties if you are running
your tests using the PyDev IDE environment.


Adding risk_in_a_box to your python path:
.........................................

Lastly, you should add the riab plugin folder to your PYTHONPATH so that
package and module paths can be resolved correctly. E.g::

	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:${HOME}/.qgis/python/plugins/risk_in_a_box

Once again you could add this to your .bashrc or set it in Eclipse for convenience
if needed.

Running tests
.............

You can run all tests (which includes code coverage reports and other
diagnostics) by doing this within the risk_in_a_box plugin folder::

	make test

You can also run individual tests using nose. For example to run the riabclipper
test you would do::

	nosetests -v gui.test_riabclipper


Coding Standards
================

Please observe the following coding standards when working on the codebase:

* Docstrings quoted with :samp:`"""`
* Simple strings in source code should be quoted with :samp:`'`
* Coding must follow a style guide. In case of Python it is `pep8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_ and
  using the command line tool pep8 (or :samp:`make pep8`) to enforce this
* `Python documentation guide <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257>`_
* Adherence to regression/unit testing wherever possible (:samp:`make test`)
* Use of github for revision control, issue tracking and management
* Simple deployment procedure - all dependencies must be delivered with
  the plugin installer for QGIS or exist in standard QGIS installs.
* Develop in the spirit of XP/Agile, i.e. frequent releases, continuous
  integration and iterative development. The master branch should always
  be assumed to represent a working demo with all tests passing.

All strings should be internationalisation enabled. Please see :doc:`i18n` 
for details.

Branching guide
---------------

Risk In A Box follows the following simple branching model:

.. figure::  ../../release-workflow.png
   :align:   center


*New development* takes place in *master*. Master should always be maintained in a
usable state with tests passing and the code functional as far as possible such
that we can create a new release from master at short notice.

*Releases* should take place in long lived branches named after the minor version number
(we follow the `semantic versioning scheme <http://semver.org/>`_) so for example the first
release would be version 0.1 and would be in a branch from master called *release_0-1*.

After the minor release branch is made, the *point releases (patch)* are created as tags
off that branch. For example the release flow for version 0.1.0  would be:

* branch release_0.1 from master
* apply any final polishing the the relase_0-1 branch
* when we are ready to release, tag the branch as release_0-1-0
* create packages from a checkout of the tag

After the release, development should take place in master. Additional short lived
branches can be made off master while new features are worked on, and then merged into
master when they are ready.

Optionally, development can also be carried out in independent forks of the risk_in_a_box
repository and then merged into master when they are ready via a pull request or patch.

Commits to master that constitute bug fixes to existing features should be backported to
the current release branch using the :samp:`git cherry-pick` command. Alternatively, if
a fix is made in the release branch, the changeset should be applied to master where
appropriate in order to ensure that master includes all bug fixes from the release branches.


Process for developers adding a new feature
-------------------------------------------

Create a feature branch
    * git checkout -b <featurebranch> master

Write new code and tests
    ...

Publish (if unfinished)
    * git push origin <featurebranch>

To keep branch up to date
    * git checkout <featurebranch>
    * git merge origin master
    * (possibly resolve conflict and verify test suite runs)
    * git push origin <featurebranch>

When all tests pass, either merge into master
    * git checkout master
    * git merge --no-ff <featurebranch>
      (possibly resolve conflict and verify test suite runs)
    * git push origin master

Or issue a pull request through github
    ..

To delete when branch is no longer needed (though it is preferable to do
such work in a fork of the official repo).

    * git push origin :<featurebranch>


Process for checking out the release branch and applying a fix:
---------------------------------------------------------------

Create a local `tracking branch <http://book.git-scm.com/4_tracking_branches.html>`_::

	git fetch
	git branch --track release-0_1 origin/release-0_1
	git checkout release-0_1

Now apply your fix, test and commit::

	git commit -m "Fix issue #22 - results do not display"
	git push

To backport the fix to master do (you should test after cherry picking and
before pushing though)::

	git checkout master
	git cherry-pick 0fh12
	git push

To checkout someone else's fork:
--------------------------------

Example::

	git remote add jeff git://githup.com/jj0hns0n/riab.git
	git remote update
	git checkout -b impact_map jeff/impact_map
